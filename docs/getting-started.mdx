Data Models

## Intro

Unified API's goal is to simplify getting data from providers as much as possible. The flow can be summarised in three fundamental steps:

*   **Authenticate**: a user connects a wearable to your service
*   **Receive**: a webhook on your end can receive new data from the connected wearable
*   **Request**: a request on your end can be made to request past data from any time period

## Steps to get started

**[Setting up the API](/docs/api-setup)
:** in this section, you will setup the different Terra functions needed to authenticate a users and receive / request data, using one of the provided libraries (python, javascript, etc...) or the Postman API reference.

**[Authenticating users](/docs/authenticate-users)
:** in this section, you will connect a user using the prebuilt [widget](/docs/authenticate-widget)
. Alternatively, you can authenticate using the [API](/docs/authenticate-api)
 and build your own widget.

**[Getting Data](/docs/getting-data)
:** in this section, you will request data from a connected wearable, as well as setup a webhook to receive data updates for new events (e.g. a new workout)

**[Parsing Data](/docs/parsing-data)
:** in this section, you can explore in detail all the data fields and events provided by Terra

**[Customize API settings](/docs/dashboard-settings)
**: in this section, you will customise various settings for your API such as the widget, your team workspace, your usage statistics, and more

**[Mobile Setup](/docs/mobile-setup)
**: if you plan to connect to one of Apple Health, Samsung Health, or Google Health Connect, this section covers how to setup Terra on your mobile application to access these integrations
